# Development Environment for CSc 305

## Compilers and Build Environments

In order to successfully compile the source code that will be presented in the
labs and lectures, you will require the following tools installed in your
system:

* A C++ compiler. For Windows, use [Visual Studio Community
  2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). For Linux, please
  make sure you have the GNU C++ compiler version 7.4 or above. Please note that
  LLVM Clang is **not** currently supported.
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) version 3.12 or above,
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7+ or 3.x,
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

The environment in the labs is currently setup to work correctly with your
assignments, and may be easier than manually setting things up in your own
machine.

Once you have everything setup, please refer to the instructions provided in lab
1 to compile and run the sample code provided in the labs. Lecture code will be
provided without the CMake scripts, but it can be easily added to an existing
project by just copying the code.

If you have any questions about setting up your computers, please come see me
after class, email me, or schedule an appointment.
