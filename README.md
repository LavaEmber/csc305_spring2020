# CSc 305 Spring 2020

In this site you will find the following class materials (per folder):

* `lectures:` all of the lecture notes. Please not that not all lecture notes
  may be published here. If they are, they will usually be published after
  class.
* `resources:` lists of books, websites, etc. that you may find useful or
  interesting.

If you have any questions, please email me or talk to me after class. You are
**strongly** encouraged to ask any questions in person (be it during or after
class, or by appointment). Many things can be solved with a 5 minute question
over a series of emails.

**IMPORTANT:** Assignments will be given and handed in through our *conneX*
site, not through here.
